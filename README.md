# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It allows two players to play against each other, taking turns to place their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the game board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
2. The game board will be displayed, and Player 'X' will be prompted for their move.
3. Enter the row (0, 1, or 2) and column (0, 1, or 2) where you want to place your symbol ('X').
4. Player 'O' will then be prompted for their move. Follow the same process to place the 'O' symbol on the board.
5. Players continue to take turns until one player wins or the game results in a draw.
6. The game will end when a winner is declared, and the final board will be displayed along with the result.
7. If the game ends in a draw, it will be indicated on the board.

## Example Board

```
   |   |   
 X | O | X 
___|___|___
   |   |   
 O | X | O 
___|___|___
   |   |   
 X | X | O 
   |   |   
```
